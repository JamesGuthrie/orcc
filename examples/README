This folder contains examples of dataflow applications that can be compiled with ORCC.

The top networks of these applications are:
  MPEG4_SP_Decoder: orcc_testbed.xdf
  RVC_MPEG4_SP_Decoder: orcc_testbed.xdf
  Seam_carving: Top_sobel.xdf

To test them under Eclipse, right-click on the top network and Run As > ORCC Compilation
The output folder should be set to:
  MPEG4_SP_Decoder -> output/MPEG4_SP_Decoder/src
  RVC_MPEG4_SP_Decoder -> output/RVC_MPEG4_SP_Decoder/src
  Seam_carving -> output/Seam_carving/src

The output folders contain Makefiles and Visual Studio projects.

There are other top networks that may be used with ORCC (e.g. for tests), but
their use is not documented yet.
