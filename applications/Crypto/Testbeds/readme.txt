This folder accommodates testbeds of RVC-CAL CTL FUs.

Due to the discrepancies between Orcc and OpenDF, we chose to keep the files to pass Orcc simulation.
If you want to test the files with OpenDF, you need to do the following:
-- copy all needed CAL/XDF files from CTL to the sub-folder "Testbed";
-- read the "readme.txt" file in the root folder to find out if they need to comment/uncomment some lines in some CAL files;
-- try to run those XDF files ending with "_OpenDF.xdf".
