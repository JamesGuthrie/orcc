ARC4_testbed.XDF is the testbed, which has been tested under both Orcc and OpenDF.
Source_ARC4.cal and Validator_ARC4.cal are used by the testbed to get data and validate the response.

To test with OpenDF, you need to uncomment some lines in Validator_ARC4.cal.
Search for "OpenDF" to find where these lines are.
