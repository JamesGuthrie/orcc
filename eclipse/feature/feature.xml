      The Open RVC-CAL Compiler (Orcc) is a collection of support tools
under BSD license created by IETR/INSA Rennes for the RVC-CAL
dataflow programming language. Its primary purpose is to provide
developers with a compiler infrastructure to allow several languages
and combination of languages (in the case of co-design) to be
generated from RVC-CAL actors and XDF networks.
