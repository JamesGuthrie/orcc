1.2       unreleased
====================

Notable changes and features
----------------------------
- Front-end: experimental support of new floating point types (half and double).
- New LLVM backend with static compilation (the old version is renamed as Jade 
backend).
- For backends which export a runtime library (c, tta, Java, llvm), it is now
possible to desactivate this export, to not overwrite user-modified library.
- LLVM/Jade backends: experimental support of floating point type.
- TTA backend: 
	* new interconnection mechanism between the processors.
	* support simulation and profiling using ttasim (experimental branch of TCE).
	* add option to choose the configuration of the processors between several 
	predefined profiles. 
	* support the mapping of several actors on the same processor.
- C/LLVM backend : Folder structure of generated application has changed. It is now
  /
  |-bin/
  |-build/
  |-libs/
  |  |-orcc/
  |  |-roxml/
  |  |-windows/
  |-src
  CMake must be run from the root folder of the application (and not
  from src/ anymore)
  Final executable is now written in bin/ folder
	
Bugfixes
--------
- UI: Removing an existing mapping was not possible without removing the runtime
configuration.
- Tools: The normalizer is working back and it has been improved to avoid useless
memory copies from the FIFOs.

Misc
----
- Move the 'models' plugin in Orcc repository and remove dependencies to dftools.
