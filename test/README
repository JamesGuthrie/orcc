Test cases that end with "_fail.cal" are expected to make Cal2C fail.
They contain semantic errors, such as references to undeclared variables, or assignment to a non-assignable variable, etc.
Some of these tests are labeled "opendf_ok_cal2c_fail" because the case is not accepted by Cal2C, which I believe is the correct behavior, but passes with OpenDF.

scope01_opendf_ok_cal2c_fail.cal: two input ports have the same name
scope02_opendf_ok_cal2c_fail.cal: an input port has the same name as an output port
scope03_succeed: a parameter and an input have same names
scope04_fail: a parameter has the same name as an actor variable
scope05_fail: two actor variables with the same name
...
scope20_fail: a variable b is declared in a block and another variable is declared in an inner block that is also named b
scope21_fail: two procedures with the same name
