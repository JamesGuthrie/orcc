------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 Prerequisites
                                 -------------

- Objective Caml (or OCaml for short), downloadable from:
  http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
Minimum version of OCaml that ORCC compiles with is 3.11

To install OCaml, you can either:
  - (Linux) compile it from source
  - (Linux) install it using your package manager:
    - on Debian/Ubuntu:
        apt-get install ocaml-compiler-libs ocaml-native-compilers
    - other platforms: ?
  - (Windows) download binary (or compile from source)
    You will need the following tools:
    - a build environment, one of:
      - Cygwin, available from http://www.cygwin.com/
        You only need to click "devel/gcc", "devel/make", and "devel/patchutils".
      - MinGW/MSYS, available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
        You will have to install the following:
        (1) MinGW (tested with 5.1.4)     http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.1.4.exe?use_mirror=
        (2) MSYS (tested with 1.0.11rc1)  http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11-rc-1.exe?use_mirror=

    - Flexdll from http://alain.frisch.fr/flexdll.html#download
      Extract it wherever you want, say C:\flexdll, and add this folder to your PATH
      Once this is done, before using OCaml, you need to set Flexdll's flags on MinGW:
        export FLEXLINKFLAGS="-L C:\MinGW\lib"
      This is not necessary on Cygwin because flexdll uses cygpath to get the path to the libraries.


- ocamlgraph, available from http://ocamlgraph.lri.fr/index.en.html
Compile ocamlgraph (with the classic ./configure, make, make install)
Note: "make install" of ocamlgraph-1.0 is currently broken on Windows because it assumes a OCaml MSVC port.
You will need to type one of:
  - if you use Cygwin/MinGW
      cp graph.a $OCAMLLIB
  - if you use Windows command prompt (cmd)
      copy graph.a %OCAMLLIB%

                            Compiling ORCC frontend
                            -----------------------

make all
  Builds debug and release versions of ORCC frontend
make help
  Get help and see available targets

This is it!

                             Editing ORCC frontend
                             ---------------------

A few IDEs exist for OCaml (apart from Emacs + make), I use OcaIDE under Eclipse.
Before installing and using OcaIDE, make sure:
  1) that under Linux, your default JRE is a Sun, not a GNU (gcj).
  2) that your variable OCAMLLIB points to the folder where lies OCaml library,
  /usr/local/lib/ocaml if you compiled it from source on Linux, and
  C:\ocamlmgw\lib if you compiled it from source on Windows.

                                Troubleshooting
                                ---------------

If something does not work, here are a few tips that may solve the problem.

Is there an OCAMLLIB environment variable set to the output of
  ocamlc -where
Is ocamlgraph correctly installed in the standard library folder?
  - if you did not make install as root, it may not be the case
