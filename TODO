correct bugs in classifier and normalizer

allow arbitrary-sized integers in Fifo_int class
allow computations on arbitrary-sized integers in the interpreter
investigate the possibility of doing computations on arbitrary-sized integers in C (possibly add an option for that)

check to see how to use build path with Xtext
how do use qualified names in Graphiti?

implement I/O actors
re-write FIFOs

set "type" feature of TypeList as containment="true"
remove "transient" and replace by containment="true" in the PostProcessor.ext
add EcoreUtil.copy everywhere so the whole thing works
