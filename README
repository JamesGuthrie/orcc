This file describes how to use Orcc.

Orcc is made of several components:
  - a frontend that takes XDF networks and RVC-CAL actors, transforms them,
    and outputs a single flattened XDF network and actors under an
    Intermediate Representation (IR).
  - several backends that generate code from a flat XDF network and actors
    in IR form.
  - an Eclipse plugin that allows users to compile their dataflow program
    seamlessly.

The frontend is located in the "frontend" folder, and the backends and
plugin reside in the "plugin" folder.

Please read the INSTALL file to see how to build Orcc.


Using Orcc plugin:
  Just right-click an XDF file and Run As > Orcc Compilation,
a wizard will ask you to specify some settings, will create a launch
configuration, and compile your network. You can later access the configuration
created, and run it again to recompile your model.

Using Orcc on the command-line:
  Orcc may also be used on the command-line by calling the frontend and
backend separately.
Please see the README files located in the "frontend" and "plugin" folders
(in this order) to read more about how to run the different components.
